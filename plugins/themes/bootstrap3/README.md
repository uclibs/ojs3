# Bootstrap3 for OJS 3+

A community-built theme for OJS 3+ that implements Bootstrap 3 components.

## Installation

This theme can be installed through the **Plugin Gallery** in Open Journal Systems. If it's not available in the plugin gallery, you may need to update Open Journal Systems to a compatible version.

## Project Aims

This project was born at the [2016 PKP Sprint](https://pkp.sfu.ca/2016/04/29/sprinting-in-montreal/) in Montreal. It aims to provide a common starting point for anyone who wants to build a custom theme for OJS 3+.

The goal was to stay true to Bootstrap 3's core components, so that developers familiar with the HTML, CSS and JavaScript framework can more easily read and customize the code base. By sticking close to Bootstrap 3's supported components, the theme is able to more easily leverage the many existing Bootstrap 3 resources out there.

## Contribution

This theme is built by the community of editors, administrators and software developers using OJS. If you see something that could be improved, please issue a Pull Request.
